#BrunBot

##Discord bot template 
###WIP

The goal is to provide a solid template to start any discord bot project

As of now the bot create its own dedicated channels when it gets on a server.

A command channel which is the only one the bot listen for and a feed channel for the bot to post from social feeds(not yet implemented).
