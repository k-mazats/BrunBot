## Discord bot template 
### WIP

The goal is to provide a solid template to start any discord bot project

As of now the bot create its own dedicated channels when it gets on a server.
A command channel which is the only one the bot listen for and a feed channel for the bot to post from social feeds or web services(not yet implemented).

It can listen for commands and tell you if it's missing arguments. We planned a way for each command to be able to produce custom error message.

And finally it can store guilds configs in a local json based db.
